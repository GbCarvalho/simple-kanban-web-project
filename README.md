# Simple Kanban - Web
 A simple kanban web project, you must have the [kanban backend project](https://github.com/GbCarvalho/simple-kanban-backend-project)  initialized

# Instructions
To run this project you first need to initialize the backend and then execute:

Case Yarn:
```
  yarn
  yarn start
```

Case NPM:
```
  npm install
  npm start
```
(I recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but feel free to use npm)

Then you should be fine.
